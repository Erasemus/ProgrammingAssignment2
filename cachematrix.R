## These functions return the inverse of a matrix. If this inverse has already been computed and cached

## This function computes the inverse of the special
## "matrix" returned by `makeCacheMatrix` above. If the inverse has
## already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the
## `cachesolve` retrieves the inverse from the cache.

        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
